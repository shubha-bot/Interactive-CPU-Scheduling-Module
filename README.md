# Interactive CPU Scheduling Module using Waterfall Model 🧠💻

This project was developed as a **group project** during our **4th semester** under the mentorship of **Dr. Kamlesh Chandra Purohit**, as part of the **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** curriculum.

The project is titled **"Interactive CPU Scheduling Module using Waterfall Model"** and aims to simulate and visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms using a structured software development approach.

## 🧩 Project Objective
To build an interactive and educational module that demonstrates the working of CPU scheduling algorithms (like FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin) through the phases of the **Waterfall Model**, helping users understand both the algorithmic logic and software development lifecycle.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Simulates **FCFS, SJF, SRTF, and Round Robin** scheduling
- Visual representation using **charts and Gantt diagrams**
- Step-by-step demonstration of the **Waterfall Model** stages
- Calculation of **Turnaround Time**, **Waiting Time**, **Completion Time**, etc.
